    % wal_e is the data measured by Walabot

    % wal_T is the time stamps in seconds recorded by walabot.
    % take fft of the data to figure out the frequency of heart rates and
    % breath rates. What will be the sampling frequnecy in Frequnecy
    % domain? (Think about the Time windowing you are doing)
